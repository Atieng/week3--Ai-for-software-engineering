## AI Tools Assignment: Mastering the AI Toolkit
### Project Overview
This project demonstrates proficiency in major AI frameworks through three core tasks: classical machine learning with Scikit-learn, deep learning with TensorFlow, and NLP with spaCy.

#### Task 1: Classical ML with Scikit-learn
- Dataset: Iris Species
- Model: Decision Tree Classifier
- Results: >95% accuracy with detailed evaluation metrics

#### Task 2: Deep Learning with TensorFlow
- Dataset: MNIST Handwritten Digits
- Model: CNN Architecture
- Results: >95% test accuracy with prediction visualizations

#### Task 3: NLP with spaCy
- Dataset: Amazon Product Reviews
- Tasks: Named Entity Recognition & Sentiment Analysis
- Results: Entity extraction and rule-based sentiment classification

#### Ethics & Troubleshooting
- Bias analysis for both datasets
- Debugged TensorFlow model with fixes

- Ethical considerations and mitigation strategies
